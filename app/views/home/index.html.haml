      %p
        If you're organising a gift exchange for your family or workplace, let
        Secret Santa take care of the organising for you. Easily add lists of your
        contacts, send out notification emails, and shuffle your list of santas.

      %h3 How it works
      %p
        Once you have your list of Santas, let computer take care of the rest!
        It will shuffle all your users around, no matter how big your list is, and
        randomly assign each person a Santa. Once everyone is assigned, each Santa
        recieves a notification email letting them know what the details are.

      %h3 It's free!
      %p
        Secret Santa is free to use. There's no adverts, no spamming and we keep
        your details safe. The Secret Santa is free to use for lists of up to 15
        people, but if you need more, we offer bigger list sizes.
